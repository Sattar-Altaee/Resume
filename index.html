     <h2>Summary</h2>
    
        I am 26 years old, I am interested in programming and I have started learning now.<br> I started for the first time in 2020, but didn't really follow through.<br>
        
        Now I'm going to follow through and not let go until I can program everything and program well.
    
        My goal is to make programming my main job because I love programming and working from home.</h3>
